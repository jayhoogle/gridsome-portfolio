**A website for a new charity to help those who have experienced gambling-related harm.**

GamLEARN is a brand new charity that was looking for a website that matched their ambitions.

I designed the site in Figma and built it in the names.co.uk web builder. GamLEARN had already set up a placeholder site on names.co.uk, and therefore keeping everything in one place made sense.

I built the site in a way that made use of "Collections", names.co.uk's data handling feature, which allows the organisation to keep their site data up-to-date without requiring a developer to alter the site.
