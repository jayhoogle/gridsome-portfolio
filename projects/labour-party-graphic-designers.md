**A new graphic design collective within the labour movement launched in 2019 and was looking for a proper online presence to show off their artwork.**

I built this site in Webflow, and designed a data structure to allow for a few very specific requirements - the PDF embed for the artpack that is the centrepiece of every quarter, a foreword and list of designers involved in each artpack, as well as a directory of contactable designers with their details listed.
