**A campaign to reform gambling legislation was looking for a website to launch and support their campaign.**

This site had to host a few important features - a lobby tool to email MPs, a blog to keep people up-to-date on the campaign's progress, and some tools to share key figures on social media.

I built the site in Next.js using TailwindCSS with data powered by Sanity.io. I also built a few static tools which generated Open Graph images, hosted on Vercel, to power the key figure tools you can see on the homepage.
