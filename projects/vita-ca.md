**A modern website for a modern consultancy.**

I designed and built this website for the new Vita CA consultancy.

The client had several requirements for the site â€“ that it be friendly, professional and built to support Wordpress.org.

This website was designed in Figma and I used the [Duotone Cartoon Set](https://designs.ai/graphicmaker/illustrations/Duotone_Cartoon_Set) to bring the consultancy, which prides itself on plain speaking and human-focused solutions, to life.

I used the Oxygen framework to develop the theme and apply it to the site, along with setting up the other requirements for a modern site, including Cookie bars, caching and analytics.
