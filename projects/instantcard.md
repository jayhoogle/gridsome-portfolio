**A tool to quickly generate high-quality images from articles for sharing on social media.**

While working with [LabourList](https://labourlist.org), I wanted to help grow the social media following on Instagram, and took to designing images in Figma to get the kind of control over style that I wanted.

As I developed a brand, I realised that I could turn this into a tool which would automate half of the work I was manually doing.

I launched it [on ProductHunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/instantcard) in May 2021 and got my first paying customers (and real customer feedback). I've continued to add features to the tool and enjoyed developing a SaaS product.
